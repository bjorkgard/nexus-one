## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-26

### Added

- Nexus One now opens as a full-window 3D canvas (React Three Fiber on three.js) with a "Nexus One" title overlay styled with Tailwind CSS.
- If the 3D view cannot start, for example when WebGL is blocked or unavailable, the app shows a readable error message instead of a blank page, and screen readers announce it.
- The whole window uses a dark background, including overscroll areas and the moment before the app loads.
- Component edits during development now update in place without a page reload (Fast Refresh).

### Removed

- The Vite starter page, its counter demo and starter images.
